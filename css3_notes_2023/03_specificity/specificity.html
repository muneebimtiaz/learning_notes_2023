    <p>Inline Styles - 1000 <br>ID selectors - 100 <br>Classes, Attributes and Pseudo-classes - 10 <br>Elements and Pseudo-elements - 1 <br>Universal - 0</p>
    <p>A universal selector (*) has no specificity and gets 0 points. This means that any rule with 1 or more points will override it</p>
    <p>An element (type) or pseudo-element selector gets 1 point of specificity .</p>
    <p>A class, pseudo-class or attribute selector gets 10 points of specificity.</p>
    <p>An ID selector gets 100 points of specificity, as long as you use an ID selector (#myID) and not an attribute selector ([id="myID"]).</p>
    <p>CSS applied directly to the style attribute of the HTML element, gets a specificity score of 1,000 points. This means that in order to override it in CSS, you have to write an extremely specific selector.</p>
    <h5>!important rule #</h5>
    <p>Lastly, an !important at the end of a CSS value gets a specificity score of 10,000 points. This is the highest specificity that one individual item can get. An !important rule is applied to a CSS property, so everything in the overall rule (selector and properties) does not get the same specificity score.</p>
