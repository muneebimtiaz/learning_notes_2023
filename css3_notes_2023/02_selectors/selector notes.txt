We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

1-Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
    id,class,type/element,universal,grouping
2-Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
    descendent,child,adjacent sibling,general sibling
3-Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
4-Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
5-Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
