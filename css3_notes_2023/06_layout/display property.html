        A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs. This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions <span class="a">hello</span> <span class="a">bye</span> of an essay begin and end, and thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.
