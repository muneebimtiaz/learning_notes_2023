"The way the gradient is positioned is similar to how you set the position of a background 
using keywords or numbers. The size of the radial gradient determines the ending shape
(circle or ellipse), and by default, it reaches the farthest corner of the element from the
center. You can also use these keywords:

'closest-corner' makes the gradient reach the nearest corner to its center.
'closest-side' makes the gradient reach the side of the element nearest to its center.
'farthest-side' does the opposite of 'closest-side'.
You can also have multiple color changes in the gradient, just like with linear gradients. And, you can use as many radial gradients as you want."
