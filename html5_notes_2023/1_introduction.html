    <!-- the contents of the <title>
        element are either shown in the 
        top of the browser, above where 
        you usually type in the URL of 
        the page you want to visit, or 
        on the tab for that page (if your 
        browser uses tabs to allow you 
        to view multiple pages at the 
        same time). -->
</head>
<!-- Before the <body> element you 
    will often see a <head> element. 
    This contains information 
    about the page (rather than 
    information that is shown within 
    the main part of the browser 
    window that is highlighted in 
    blue on the opposite page). 
    You will usually find a <title>
    element inside the <head>
    element -->

<body>
    <!-- You met the <body> element 
        in the first example we created. 
        Everything inside this element is 
        shown inside the main browser 
        window. -->


Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are 
    made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign

<p lang="en-us">Paragraph in English</p>
The attribute name indicates what kind of extra information you are supplying about the element's content. It should be 
    written in lowercase.
The value is the information or setting for the attribute. It should be placed in double quotes. Different attributes can 
    have different values.
Here an attribute called lang is used to indicate the language used in this element. The value of this attribute on this page 
    specifies it is in US English.


-> HTML pages are text documents.
-> HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled 
brackets) to give the information they surround special 
meaning.
-> Tags are often referred to as elements.
-> Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes 
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes 
the end.
-> Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more 
about the content of that element.
-> Attributes require a name and a value.
