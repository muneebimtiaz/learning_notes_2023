    <!-- Paragraph -->
    <p>By default, a browser will show 
    each paragraph on a new line 
    with some space between it and 
    any subsequent paragraphs.</p>

    <!-- Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules -->

    <!-- White Space -->
    When the browser comes across 
    two or more spaces next to each 
    other, it only displays one space. 
    Similarly if it comes across a line 
    break, it treats that as a single 
    space too. This is known as 
    white space collapsing.

    <!-- Semantic Markup  -->
    There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the pages — they are known as semantic markup</p>
    <strong>The use of the this tag element indicates that its content has strong importance. For example, the words contained in this element might be said with strong emphasis.By default, browsers will show the contents of a this tag element in bold.</strong>
    <em>The element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence.By default browsers will show the contents of an emphasis tag element in italic.</em>

    <!-- Quotation -->
    <blockquote>The blockquote element is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph.</blockquote>
    <q>The q element is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph.</q>
